Samples of Dow Jones Hammer configuration files are available at `deployment/configs/`.

There are three configuration files for Dow Jones Hammer:
* `deployment/configs/config.json` - this is the main configuration file for Dow Jones Hammer;
* `deployment/configs/ticket_owners.json` - this configuration file contains more specific settings for JIRA integration;
* `deployment/configs/whitelist.json` - this configuration file describes issues, that you have to override before Dow Jones Hammer will scan your AWS landscape.

## 1. Configure General Dow Jones Hammer Configuration Parameters

### 1.1. Master AWS Account Settings

You should add the following settings to the **aws** section of the `config.json` configuration file to define Dow Jones Hammer deployment specifics.

**Required keys**
* **main_account_id**: the ID of the master AWS account where you will deploy Dow Jones Hammer;
* **region**: the region of the master AWS account where you will deploy Dow Jones Hammer. This value is used only as a fallback when automatic detection of AWS deployment region is failed;
* **role_name_identification**: name of the IAM cross-account role for the issues identification functionality. **Make sure** the value of this parameter matches the value you've used for `LambdaIAMCrossAccountRole` when deploying [IAM Cross-account Identification Role](deployment_cloudformation.html#411-iam-cross-account-identification-role);
* **role_name_reporting**: name of the IAM cross-account role for the issues reporting and remediation functionality. **Make sure** the value of this parameter matches the value you've used for `EC2IAMCrossAccountRole` when deploying [IAM Cross-account Reporting/Remediation Role](deployment_cloudformation.html#412-iam-cross-account-reportingremediation-role);
* **accounts**: IDs of slave AWS accounts that Dow Jones Hammer will check. In case you want Dow Jones Hammer to check master account - add master account ID here as well;
* **s3_backup_bucket**: name of the [pre-created](configuredeploy_overview.html#24-create-s3-buckets-for-hammer) S3 backup bucket for the [remediation rollback functionality](remediation_backup_rollback.html).


**Optional keys**:
* **regions**: limits checks to only specified regions. In case you have not specified this key, Dow Jones Hammer will check in the slave accounts the same list of regions as in the Dow Jones Hammer master account. In case you have specified the key, but with an empty value, Dow Jones Hammer will check **no regions** in the slave account(s) at all;
* **ddb_backup**: configures setting for the DynamoDB tables backup:
    * **enabled**: enables/disables DynamoDB table backup. The default value is `false`;
    * **retention_days**: sets the retention period for DynamoDB table backup. The default value is `7` days.

Configuration example:
```
"aws": {
    "main_account_id": "123456789012",
    "region": "eu-west-1",
    "role_name_identification": "hammer-cloudsec-crossact-id",
    "role_name_reporting": "hammer-cloudsec-crossact-ec2",
    "accounts": {
        "123456789012": "master",
        "210987654321": "slave1"
    },
    "s3_backup_bucket": "hammer-backup-bucket",
    "ddb_backup": {
        "enabled": true,
        "retention_days": 7
    }
}
```

### 1.2. Scheduling Settings

You can configure the scheduling parameters for reporting and remediation jobs to occur. **This is an optional step**.

The **cronjobs** section of the `config.json` file defines how periodically reporting and remediation jobs will run.
Please use the standard **crontab** syntax to define the timing of these jobs' runs.

Configuration example:
```
"cronjobs": {
    "reporting": "5 * * * *",
    "remediation": "30 10 * * *"
}
```

**Note**: the default frequency of identification Lambda function runs is `once an hour`. To decrease this frequency please use:
* the CloudFormation parameter [IdentificationCheckRateExpression](deployment_cloudformation.html#313-identification-functionality);
* the Terraform variable [identificationCheckRateExpression](deployment_terraform.html#32-the-variablestf-file).

### 1.3. Reporting Setup (JIRA/Slack)
The following sections define the integration of Dow Jones Hammer with JIRA and/or Slack for reporting purposes. As soon as this step is optional, you can configure one integration, both, or none.

**Note**: for JIRA or Slack integration to be functional, **after** successful Dow Jones Hammer deployment
you should [inject corresponding access credentials](configuredeploy_overview.html#41-access-credentials-storage) to the credentials DynamoDB table defined in `credentials` section of `config.json`:
```
"credentials": {
    "ddb.table_name": "hammer-credentials"
},
```

#### 1.3.1. JIRA Integration

**Note**:
* you can use Dow Jones Hammer with any JIRA version that is supported by [jira library](https://pypi.org/project/jira/).
* Dow Jones Hammer supports only `OAuth` authentication on JIRA server. You need to [configure JIRA application accordingly](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18153033/jira-python-oauth-how-to-get-the-parameters-for-authentication) and
[inject corresponding access credentials](configuredeploy_overview.html#41-access-credentials-storage) to the credentials DynamoDB table.

To configure JIRA integration parameters, you should edit the following configuration files:

1. The `config.json` file, **jira** section, following parameters:
    * **enabled**: enables/disables Dow Jones Hammer and JIRA integration. The default value is `false`;
    * **server**: defines the root URL of your JIRA server. The default value is `https://issues.example.com`;
    * **issue_type**: defines the type of JIRA issue that Dow Jones Hammer will raise in case it detects a vulnerability. The default value is `Task`.

    Configuration example:
    ```
    "jira": {
        "enabled": false,
        "server": "https://issues.example.com",
        "issue_type": "Task"
    }
    ```

2. The `ticket_owners.json` file, following parameters:
    * **jira_project**: JIRA project
    * **jira_owner**: JIRA assignee
    * **jira_parent_ticket**: JIRA parent ticket

    You can specify these parameters at **AWS account specific** or **global** settings. **AWS account specific** settings precede the **global** settings.

    Configuration example:
    ```
    {
        "account": {
            "1234567890123": {
                "jira_project": "AWSCORESEC",
                "jira_owner": "DevOps-CORE",
                "jira_parent_ticket": "AWSSEC-4321"
            }
        },
        "jira_project": "AWSSEC",
        "jira_owner": "DevOps-ENTERPRISE",
        "jira_parent_ticket": "AWSSEC-1234"
    }
    ```

    Also Dow Jones Hammer tries to detect person to report issue to by examining `owner` tag on affected resource (Security Group, S3 bucket, EBS volume/snapshot, RDS snapshot, etc).
    In case when such tag **exists** and is **valid JIRA user**, `jira_owner` parameter **is ignored** and discovered `owner` **is used instead** as a JIRA assignee.

#### 1.3.2. Slack Integration

There are two groups of messages which you can configure to forward to Slack:
* **hammer-internal** messages (logged to CloudWatch Logs) should be monitored to control Dow Jones Hammer functionality, [access problems](logging.html#6-logging-slave-account-access-problems), etc;
* **issue-specific** messages should be used for reporting purposes during issue lifecycle.

Also, in case Slack integration is enabled, Dow Jones Hammer Slack bot is launched. You can interact with it by sending direct messages or invite to any channel. Send `help` to get the list of supported commands. You can use it to check:
* Dow Jones Hammer status;
* configuration details.

To configure Slack integration parameters, you should edit the following configuration files:

1. The `config.json` file, **slack** section, following parameters:
    * **enabled**: globally enables/disables Dow Jones Hammer and Slack integration (for both **hammer-internal** and **issue-specific** messages, as well as for Dow Jones Hammer Slack bot). The default value is `false`;
    * **channels**: defines the patterns of **hammer-internal** messages that Dow Jones Hammer will post to Slack and the destination channels. The keys are Slack channels, the values are lists with PCRE regular expressions;
    * **ignore**: defines the patterns of **hammer-internal** messages that Dow Jones Hammer will not post to Slack channels. The keys are Slack channels, the values are lists with PCRE regular expressions;
    * **default_channel**: defines the default Slack channel where Dow Jones Hammer will post **hammer-internal** messages if there is no more specific message destination.

    Configuration example:
    ```
    "slack": {
        "enabled": true,
        "channels": {
            "hammer-errors": ["ERROR|WARNING|ALARM|Task timed out after|Access denied"]
        },
        "ignore": [],
        "default_channel": "hammer-dev"
    }
    ```

2. **slack_owner** parameter in the `ticket_owners.json` file to configure forwarding of **issue-specific** messages to Slack. The value of this parameter is a list with Slack channels (`#` prefixed) or users that will receive issue reports from Dow Jones Hammer.

    You can specify these parameter at **AWS account specific** or **global** settings. **AWS account specific** settings precede the **global** settings.

    Configuration example:
    ```
    {
        "account": {
            "1234567890123": {
                "slack_owner": "#devops-1234567890123"
            }
        },
        "slack_owner": ["#devops", "bob"]
    }
    ```
    Also Dow Jones Hammer tries to detect person to report issue to by examining `owner` tag on affected resource (Security Group, S3 bucket, EBS volume/snapshot, RDS snapshot, etc).
    In case when such tag **exists** and is **valid Slack user**, discovered `owner` **is used in addition to** `slack_owner` value.

### 1.4. Reporting Setup (CSV)

You can configure Dow Jones Hammer to send CSV with detected vulnerabilities to designated S3 bucket on a regular basis.
Use following configuration parameters in **csv** section:
* **enabled**: enables/disables CSV reporting;
* **schedule**: defines schedule for CSV reporting. Please use the standard **crontab** syntax to define the timing of this job;
* **slack_channel**: name of the slack channel (`#` prefixed) or user to send CSV reports to;
* **bucket**: name of the pre-created S3 bucket to put CSV reports to.

Configuration example:
```
"csv": {
    "enabled": true,
    "schedule": "0 9 * * 1",
    "bucket": "hammer-backup-bucket",
    "slack_channel": "#hammer-prod"
},
```
